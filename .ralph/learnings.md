# Learnings

> Persistent knowledge from failures and discoveries. READ THIS FIRST every iteration.

## Failed Approaches

<!--
When something fails, document WHY so future iterations don't repeat it.

Format:
- **task-id**: "Tried [approach], failed because [reason]. Don't [thing to avoid]."
-->

## Gotchas

<!--
Project-specific discoveries that prevent future failures.

Examples:
- "API rate limits to 100 req/min - add delays in batch operations"
- "Tests require DB seed first or fail with empty tables"
-->

## Patterns That Work

<!--
Successful approaches worth remembering.

Examples:
- "For new endpoints: copy structure from src/api/users.ts"
- "Use renderWithProviders helper for component tests"
-->
